# what about notebooks 3 and 4?
* if you rename them now, and __`git pull`__ you will get intact copies of my notebooks 3 and 4
* the existing notebooks 3 and 4 have _conflict markers_ in them, indicating where your notebooks differ from mine
  * if you open then in a text editor, look for lines that begin with <<<<, ====, >>>> and you can get rid of those...or use a mergetool which is git's way of allowing you to resolve conflicts
